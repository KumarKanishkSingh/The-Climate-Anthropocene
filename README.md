# The Climate Anthropocene

In this analysis of climate data, we identified clear trends and seasonality patterns. The data revealed a consistent increase in temperatures over the years. Each year, temperatures peaked around May before gradually declining. To forecast future temperatures, we applied an ARIMA(3,1,2) model, which suggests that temperatures will continue to rise in the coming years.

These findings reinforce the reality of global warming, highlighting a concerning upward trend in temperatures. This emphasizes the urgent need for significant actions to ensure a sustainable future for the generations to come.
